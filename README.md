C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to help instruct programming in C++.

These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems.

Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more C++ newbies or teachers.

C++ is by far the most popular programming language for competitive programmers.

It offers a library called STL (Standard Template Library).

STL is a collection of C++ template classes that provides common data structures and functions
